**About the Project**

While building this model we used various data treatment methods like outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, Grid search CV for hyperparameter tuning, k-fold cross-validation, Linear Regression and more to make data useful for the project and generate the insights we required for the project.


**Technologies and Tools**

This project utilizes the following technologies and tools:

	Python: A programming language for the project, build functions and various other operations performed.
	NumPy and Pandas: These two Libraries were used for data loading, cleaning, and manipulation.
	Matplotlib: This Python Library was used for the data visualization which was helpful to understand the data. 
	Scikit-Learn: Various frameworks were used with the help of Scikit-learn for building the predictive model.
	Visual Studio Code: IDE used for Python as well as jupyter Notebook.
	Python Flask: The web server was built to make the backend and run the predictive model.
	HTML/CSS/JavaScript: These were used to make a simple website showcasing the predictive model working.



**Project Structure:-**

Data Loading and Cleaning: Load and Clean the data to prepare it for model building.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data using Python Libraries to understand patterns and relationships between the data.
Model Building: Constructing a predictive model using models and library Scikit-learn, including hyperparameter tuning.
Saving the Model: Saving the trained model to use it in future.
Flask Server Development: Developing a Python Flask server to serve HTTP requests and predict prices.
Website Development: Creating a simple website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase the predictive model.
